# Base React components library  
  I always liked the idea of building code as lego-block, re-usable in various context, allowing us to create fantastic projects with minimum effort.  
    
This repository is a base component library that everyone could use in order to start his journey in developing his own component library.  
   
 ## Usage  
 Install project depencencies
	
	npm install
    
   In order to build your library you should use the 'build' script, configured in package.json

	npm run build

If you want to start Styleguidist docs, you should use the following command
